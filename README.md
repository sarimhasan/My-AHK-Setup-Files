# My AHK Setup Files
 ### These are my AHK files that I made by learning some AHk online and got the major part of it by watching the video tutorial of the one and only [**Taran Van Hemert**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3vG8U5RoFw).
 ### So basically if you are new in the world of autoHotkey, it is basically a free and open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows that was initially aimed for providing easy keyboard shrtcuts and fast macro creation. You can start by downloading it [here][AHK].
 ---
 ### So Lets get started
 1. ### Hoping you have downloaded [autoHotkey][AHK]
 2. ### Now right click on your desktop, then select "new", then autoHotkey script
<img src="./Support Files/Readme%20files/AHK%20Script%20making.gif" alt="making a new ahk file" width="300"/>

 3. ### Then give it a name supposedly, my fist ahk script, and press Enter.
<img src="./Support%20Files/Readme%20files/file%20name.png" alt="file name"/>

 3. ### Then again right click on it and click "Edit Script"
 4. ### the file should look like this
<img src="./Support%20Files/Readme%20files/script%20first%20look.png" alt="Script first look"/>

### This script could look a bit scary but don't worry, you'll eventually get it.
 5. ### So to get started paste the code down below in you ahk script.
